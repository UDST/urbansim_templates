UrbanSim Templates
==================

UrbanSim Templates provides building blocks for Orca-based simulation models. It's part of the `Urban Data Science Toolkit <http://docs.udst.org>`__ (UDST).

The library contains templates for common types of model steps, plus a tool called ModelManager that runs as an extension to the `Orca <https://udst.github.io/orca>`__ task orchestrator. ModelManager can register template-based model steps with the orchestrator, save them to disk, and automatically reload them for future sessions.

v0.2.dev9, released July 22, 2019
